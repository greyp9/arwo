# Arwo Web Application

Arwo is a web application hosted in the Apache Tomcat web container.  It is designed to provide for easy web access to
remote servers.  Its features include:

* browse the filesystems of SSH servers
* browse the filesystems of CIFS servers
* browse the filesystems of WebDAV servers
* run SQL commands on JDBC servers
* run shell commands on SSH servers
* run shell commands on Windows machines (using DCOM)
* send emails using SMTP servers
* view recent messages on IMAP email servers
* view recent messages on POP3 email servers
* manage server connections
* store "favorite" filesystem locations and commands for later use
* schedule accesses to filesystem resources (folders / files)
* schedule execution of server commands

Arwo uses additional open-source libraries internally to interface to different server types.  For each server type to
be accessed, the appropriate library / libraries should be separately downloaded.

More information about the usage of these libraries can be found on the webapp "Usage" page
[here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/greyp9/arwo/blob/master/src/main/app/resources/webapp/arwo-war/usage.html).

## Requirements

To use the webapp, a version of the Java runtime is needed, as well as a version of the Tomcat web
container.  Once these are available, the webapp should be installed into the Tomcat container.  You would then
navigate a web browser to the landing page of the webapp in the running Tomcat instance and authenticate to the
application.

Because of Tomcat classloader requirements, a standalone JAR needs to be copied into the Tomcat library folder to
provide the implementation of the webapp authentication realm.

More information is provided on the webapp "Usage" page.

## Credits

A debt of gratitude is owed to those responsible for the development of the server access libraries.  Without their
efforts, much of the functionality of this webapp would not be possible.
